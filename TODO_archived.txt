Simulator Features
- "show all" and "hide all" buttons for vectors
- put magnitudes at the tips of arrows
- arrow for acceleration due to gravity
- arrow for acceleration due to edging
- arrow for overall acceleration
- modifiable snow conditions, like powder vs. ice
- make the scale / numbers realistic

Carving Without Scraping
- as per Ryan's pointer, you can turn by putting pressure and the ski curve turns you in a nice arc with no scrape, since the skis make the arc of a giant circle (whose radius will be relevant here) so you don't go exactly straight

Slalom Race
- flags for markers instead of dots
- start line
- finish line
- side boundaries (forest of trees?)
